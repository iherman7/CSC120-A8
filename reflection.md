Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

In House, I overloaded the constructor in two different ways. I thought that it could be helpful to create a House with no information, as well as one that does not need hasDiningRoom.

In Cafe, I overloaded the constructor in two different ways again. I thought that it could be helpful to create a House with no information, as well as one that only knows the basic information as well as number of cups and hasElevator, but none of the other supplies.

In Library, I created an empty version of the constructor. I also overloaded the returnBook method to allow two books to be returned at once. I thought this would be helpful as people often return multiple items at a time.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

It helped to check the rubric in order to find out specific details about what was expected. I also found it helpful to reference the previous assignment. I also tested many of my methods in the main, especially goToFloor(). I would recommend that people taking this course in the future also reference the rubric in advance and test out their methods before submitting the assignment.
